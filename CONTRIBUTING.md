# Contributing

I would love you contribute to Tabliss!

I accept issues and pull requests for both bugs and feature requests.
If your feature is larger (like a new plugin), I suggest creating a
new issue to propose the new feature before you start.

## Looking for contribution ideas?

Check out the [github project](https://github.com/users/BookCatKid/projects/3?query=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen) for a list of features that are wanted, but not yet implemented. Anything not in `in progress` is most likely free for you to work on!

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, try to be as detailed as possible.

- For bugs, this could include:
  - The steps required to reproduce the bug.
- For feature requests, this could include:
  - Details of how the new feature should work
  - Links to supporting examples, references or documentation.
