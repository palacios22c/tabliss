# Backup & Export Settings

TablissNG allows you to export your entire configuration to a file. This is useful for backing up your settings, moving them to a new browser, or ensuring you don't lose data when switching between development and store versions.

## How to Export

1. Open a new tab to view your **TablissNG dashboard**.
2. Click the **Settings icon** (⚙️) in the corner of the screen.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Settings** section.
4. Look for the **Export** button.
5. A `.json` file containing your configuration will be downloaded to your computer.

## How to Import

1. Open the **Settings** (⚙️) on the TablissNG dashboard where you want to restore the data.
2. Find the **Import** button.
3. Select the `.json` file you previously exported.
4. Your dashboard will refresh and apply the imported settings immediately.

:::tip Data Sync & Persistence
**Browser Extensions**: If you are signed into your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge), your settings are often synced automatically across your devices.

**Web Version**: Automatic sync is not available on the web version. You can, however, use the **Persist Settings** button in the settings menu to ask your browser to protect your data from being automatically cleared. Note that browsers (especially Chrome) may occasionally deny this request. Your data is typically safe regardless, but a manual export is always the most secure option.
