:::warning Switching Versions & Data Loss
If you are moving from a **Nightly** or **Manual** build back to the **Store** version, please be aware:

- Browsers most likely will not let you easily switch back to the store version.
- Installing the store version over a manual build may require you to delete the existing one first.
- **This will delete all your settings and data.**

**Before switching, always [export your settings](../../guides/backup-and-export) from the TablissNG dashboard to ensure you don't lose your configuration.**
